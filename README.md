# hand-dial-pad

I honestly couldn't decide on a better name than this... 

Anyways, here's a rundown of this hackpad. I play Minecraft without sprint lock, so the design kinda mimics what my hand is used to. Its functions are mainly responding to stuff and controlling devices. I will probably find a better use for the LEDs, but for right now, they are on the device for fun.
